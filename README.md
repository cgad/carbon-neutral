# Carbon Neutral

## About
This is a React app created for the environmentally conscious. Carbon Neutral provides environmental impact models of a variety of day-to-day activities, including driving, flying, and owning a pet. The app's impact model forms take in variables from the user, like species and breed, and returns the impact the chosen activity has on greenhouse gas levels. Results are shown in easy-to-digest equivalents.
